# I'm currently looking for a New Adventure in DevOps

I'm a **Senior DevOps/Infrastructure Engineer** that is passionate about scalable systems, well-designed architecture, and product-driven development. 

My expertise:
- _Auto-scaling_, _auto-healing_, _rapidly scalable_, and _cost efficient_ **Ruby on Rails**, **Sidekiq**, **Java/SCORM** on **AWS Fargate** via **Cloudformation**
- _Auto-scaling_, _auto-failover_, **RDS Aurora MySQL** clusters using Rails Multi-database support
- Comprehensive **Datadog observability** using Ruby APM, Tracing, Profiling, Monitors, Synthetics, and Datadog logs integration to get full visibility
- Ensure infrastructure and deployment pipeline parity across **Commercial and GovCloud AWS regions** to support compliance, operational consistency, and streamlined cross-environment deployments
- Proactively manage the SDLC of our software stack and dependencies to **mitigate security vulnerabilities, avoid end-of-life risks**, and ensure long-term operational integrity
- Use **Copilot, OpenAI, Claude**, etc, wherever possible, to accelerate my development and workflow

My key principles:
- Keep it Simple
- Configure to rapidly scale when needed
- Pay only for what you actually need and use
- Low maintenance, limited yaml configuration necessary
- Practical DevSecOps in CI/CD (dependency versioning/management, SAST, DAST, periodic penetration tests)
- Focus on optimizing the feedback loop and speeding up the deployment pipelines
- Unblock development so that product enhancements get out faster and more reliably
  
I‚Äôm currently **open to new roles** where I can bring my expertise in infrastructure, DevOps, CI/CD automation, AWS architecture, and system reliability to help teams ship faster, scale smarter, and operate more securely.

On this page, you‚Äôll find a few highlights of my work.  If you‚Äôre interested in what I can help build for your company ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs simplifying infrastructure, improving reliability, or scaling operations ‚Äî feel free to reach out.  I‚Äôd be happy to walk you through my work and discuss how I can contribute to your team‚Äôs goals.

### Container Build and Deployment Pipeline
- Comprehensive pipeline for Pull-request to Production deployment
- Simple OCI builds via Dockerfile and Buildkit, using [best practices](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/best-practices/)
- Automated linting, unit testing, and staging deployments
- Continuous regression testing against staging, and push button Production deployments
- Automated and Deterministic builds and build configurations
- TODO: Use [ECR remote cache when building](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/announcing-remote-cache-support-in-amazon-ecr-for-buildkit-clients/)
- TODO: Use [SOCI indices for container lazy loading](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/09/introducing-seekable-oci-lazy-loading-container-images/)

### Aurora Upgrades and Scaling
- Initially migrated from Percona 5.6 to Aurora MySQL 5.7 using manual replication
- Over time, continually upgraded Aurora MySQL and eventually to Aurora MySQL 8

#### Make use of Aurora replicas with Rails
- Thank you [Rails Team](https://github.com/rails/rails)!
- Use the Aurora Reader endpoint in [Rails multi-database support configuration](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_multiple_databases.html)
- This allowed us to scale down our resources since we're now using all databases
- Aurora instances can scale vertically to hundreds of vCPUs and horizontally to 15 readers
- Massive scalability while still only paying for what you use

### Fargate Infrastructure
- Cloudformation snippet of Task Definition with JSON logging and Datadog sidecars
- Uses TargetTrackingScaling to autoscale all services.  Easily enable predictive scaling for normal day to day patterns of scaling.
- Use AWS Secrets Manager for high level secrets
- Prefer encrypted credentials files for environment specific secrets
- Rails credentials [is a great example](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#custom-credentials)

#### View and troubleshoot via e1s
- Thank you Xing Yahao for [e1s](https://github.com/keidarcy/e1s)!
- Crazy easy way to traverse multiple clusters, regions, services, tasks, and containers
- Shell into a container easily to investigate (Rails console is your friend)

- **Millions** of jobs a day
- **Billions** of jobs to date
- Autoscaling, auto-healing, Aurora Reader/Writer balanced jobs, makes use of all database resources using Rails Multi-database support
- No more unused standby databases
- Embedded cron jobs in Sidekiq configuration

### Datadog Observability
- Single Dashboard view of entire Platform and critical metrics, events, logs, infrastructure costs, etc
- Drill down to each critical service, metric, log, trace, profile, and monitor with deep integration for full visibility
- Know exactly what's happening, when it happens, and the root cause, faster (MTTK)
