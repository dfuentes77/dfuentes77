# Hi there 👋 I'm Damian

Welcome! I'm a Senior DevOps/Infrastructure Engineer passionate about scalable systems, well-designed architecture, and product-driven development. 

My recent experience is with **Ruby on Rails**, **Sidekiq**, **Java/SCORM** on **AWS Fargate** via **Cloudformation**, **RDS Aurora MySQL** autoscaling clusters and **RDS PostgreSQL/MySQL**, **Redshift** for our Datawarehouse, and **Datadog** for all observability

## I'm Open to a New Adventure

I’m currently open to new roles where I can bring my expertise in infrastructure, DevOps, CI/CD automation, AWS architecture, and system reliability to help teams ship faster, scale smarter, and operate more securely.

On this page, you’ll find a few highlights of my work.  If you’re interested in what I can help build for your company — whether it’s simplifying infrastructure, improving reliability, or scaling operations — feel free to reach out.  I’d be happy to walk you through my work and discuss how I can contribute to your team’s goals.
