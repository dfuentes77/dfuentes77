# I'm Damian.  I'm currently looking for a New Adventure in DevOps

I'm a **Senior DevOps/Infrastructure Engineer** that is passionate about scalable systems, well-designed architecture, and product-driven development. 

My expertise:
- _Auto-scaling_, _auto-healing_, _rapidly scalable_, and _cost efficient_ **Ruby on Rails**, **Sidekiq**, **Java/SCORM** on **AWS Fargate** via **Cloudformation**
- _Auto-scaling_, _auto-failover_, **RDS Aurora MySQL** clusters using Rails Multi-database support, with **Redshift** Datawarehouse
- Comprehensive **Datadog** observability using Ruby APM, Tracing, Profiling, Monitors, Synthetics, and Datadog logs integration to get full visibility 

I‚Äôm currently **open to new roles** where I can bring my expertise in infrastructure, DevOps, CI/CD automation, AWS architecture, and system reliability to help teams ship faster, scale smarter, and operate more securely.

On this page, you‚Äôll find a few highlights of my work.  If you‚Äôre interested in what I can help build for your company ‚Äî whether it‚Äôs simplifying infrastructure, improving reliability, or scaling operations ‚Äî feel free to reach out.  I‚Äôd be happy to walk you through my work and discuss how I can contribute to your team‚Äôs goals.
