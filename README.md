I'm a **Senior DevOps/Infrastructure Engineer** that is passionate about scalable systems, well-designed architecture, and product-driven development. 

My expertise:
- _Auto-scaling_, _auto-healing_, and _cost efficient_ OCI containers on **ECS Fargate** via **Cloudformation**, built and deployed via [Concourse CI](https://concourse-ci.org/) 
  - No need for cumbersome kubernetes cluster upgrades, in-place or blue-green.  No vendor lock-in (they are just containers)
- _Auto-scaling_, _auto-failover_, **RDS Aurora MySQL** using Rails Multi-database support
- Architectual management and upgrades for **Ruby on Rails**, **Sidekiq** for background job processes, and **Java/SCORM** for hosting Rustici SCORM Engine
- Comprehensive **Datadog observability** using Ruby APM, Tracing, Profiling, Monitors, Synthetics, and Datadog logs integration to get full visibility
- Ensure infrastructure and deployment pipeline parity across **Commercial and GovCloud AWS regions** to support compliance, operational consistency, and streamlined cross-environment deployments
- Proactively manage the SDLC of our software stack and dependencies to **mitigate security vulnerabilities, avoid end-of-life risks**, and ensure long-term operational integrity
- Use **Copilot, OpenAI, Claude**, etc, wherever possible, to accelerate my development and workflow

My key principles:
- Keep it Simple
- Configure to rapidly scale when needed
- Pay only for what you actually need and use
- Low maintenance, limited yaml configuration necessary
- Practical DevSecOps in CI/CD (dependency versioning/management, SAST, DAST, periodic penetration tests)
- Focus on optimizing the feedback loop and speeding up the deployment pipelines
- Unblock development so that product enhancements get out faster and more reliably
  
~~I’m currently **open to new roles** where I can bring my expertise in infrastructure, DevOps, CI/CD automation, AWS architecture, and system reliability to help teams ship faster, scale smarter, and operate more securely.~~

On this page, you’ll find a few highlights of my work.  If you’re interested in what I can help build for your company — whether it’s simplifying infrastructure, improving reliability, or scaling operations — feel free to reach out.  ~~I’d be happy to walk you through my work and discuss how I can contribute to your team’s goals.~~

- Simple OCI builds via Dockerfile and Buildkit, using [best practices](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/best-practices/)
- Automated linting, unit testing, and staging deployments
- Continuous regression testing against staging, and push button Production deployments
- Automated and Deterministic builds and build configurations
- TODO: Use [ECR remote cache when building](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/containers/announcing-remote-cache-support-in-amazon-ecr-for-buildkit-clients/)
- TODO: Use [SOCI indices for container lazy loading](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2022/09/introducing-seekable-oci-lazy-loading-container-images/)

### Aurora Upgrades and Scaling
- Initially migrated from Percona 5.6 to Aurora MySQL 5.7 using manual replication
- Over time, continually upgraded Aurora MySQL and eventually to Aurora MySQL 8

#### Make use of Aurora replicas with Rails
- Thank you [Rails Team](https://github.com/rails/rails)!
- Use the Aurora Reader endpoint in [Rails multi-database support configuration](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_multiple_databases.html)
- This allowed us to scale down our resources since we're now using all databases
- Aurora instances can scale vertically to hundreds of vCPUs and horizontally to 15 readers
- Massive scalability while still only paying for what you use

### Fargate Infrastructure
- Cloudformation snippet of Task Definition with JSON logging and Datadog sidecars
- Uses TargetTrackingScaling to autoscale all services.  Easily enable predictive scaling for normal day to day patterns of scaling.
- Use AWS Secrets Manager for high level secrets
- Prefer encrypted credentials files for environment specific secrets
- Rails credentials [is a great example](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#custom-credentials)
